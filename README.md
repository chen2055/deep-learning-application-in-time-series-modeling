1.Utilized sinusoidals to engineer time-related exogenous features that improved MAPE of a VAR model from 0.1593 to 0.1138

2.Constructed a Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) that improved MAPE from 0.1138 to 0.0813 after hyperparameter tuning

3.Created a K-Nearest-Neighbors-Dynamic-Time-Warping(KNN-DTW) model on a time-series classification problem
